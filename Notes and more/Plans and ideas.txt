### Brainstorm

##small fixes
Remove the TextChecker (Only uses the exit)
Replace FileManager with FileUtil, ie. (read_json_fil for File.read_json, path_exists for Path.exists and so on)
ConversationManager has a conversation_name which should rather be file_path
Replace error_handling with save convo -> raise error, better for debuging
Rename ConversationManager for Conversation? Easier to read and write with
Move files to Helpers for cleaner root path. (ConsoleHelper, TextChecker, FileUtil)
General code cleanup

Change mic to not cut of sentence after 5 sec
Improve system prompt
Load conversations
fix color reset in print
